When we started learning about machine learning, it was more than just attending a MOOC.
We started a journey in the new era of computing. So we started this blog to document
the path, the ups and downs, and keep a record where it takes us.

The main goal of this blog is to share our notes when going through online courses, codes
that we write, insights that we get into problems and real life scenarios where we tried
to apply the acquired knowledge. Hopefully someday we can look back and see all the gems
that we picked up during the journey.
